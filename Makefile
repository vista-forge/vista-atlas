# Git hooks are NOT managed here — the org's pre-push gate (core.hooksPath ->
# .github/githooks) already dispatches to `make check` per repo. A per-repo
# hook installer (simple-git-hooks et al.) would write into that SAME shared
# hooksPath and clobber the org-wide pre-push gate for every other repo — see
# ~/vista-forge/docs/memory/local-first-ci.md. Hook install is org-level:
# .github/scripts/install/install-githooks.sh.
